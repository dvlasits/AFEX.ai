## What is the problem

Understanding how cells work is hard and important for bio research and medicine. Lots of high quality data can be obtained from RNAseq or proteomics, but interpretation is hard.

RNAseq and proteomics provide only protein sequence, at least in the first step.

Understanding the protein interactions and their roles is important so we undestand how cell works and how we can treat diseases.

We're building explainable ML model to tell us what the individual proteins do and how we know.


What is the Problem:

Answers the question "What is life?" lol

How do we solve it?


Are you sure?


Can you do it?
