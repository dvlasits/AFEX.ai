What is the Problem:

Answers the question "What is life?" lol

Want to explain the data - not just stick an LLM at it and call it deep.

How do we solve it?


Are you sure?


Can you do it?



The Process:

Large dataset of labelled proteins.

Pairwise alignment - gives distance matrix

Get similarity matrix somehow

Then perform Markov Clustering

For every cluster we find a sequence that represents that cluster

Local-Alignment
